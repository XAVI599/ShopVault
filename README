feat: add ShopVault backup script for shop data

- Automatically backs up customers_data and inventory_data folders
  with timestamped .tar.bz2 archives.
- Detects and runs backup_db.sh to save database dumps, compressing
  the SQL output.
- Logs all actions and missing files into backup.log for audit.
- Uses bzip2 compression to keep backups compact.
- Designed for ~/Downloads/shop by default, configurable via
  files_location variable.
