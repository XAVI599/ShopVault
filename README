Welcome to ShopVault, the ultimate Bash script for keeping your shopâ€™s data safe and sound. Think of it as a trusty sidekick that quietly backs up your files, compresses them efficiently, and logs everything â€” so you never have to worry about lost data again.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Automatic File Backups
ShopVault searches your customers_data and inventory_data folders for .csv and .txt files and packages them into bzip2-compressed .tar.bz2 archives. Each archive is timestamped for easy version tracking.

Database Backups
If a backup_db.sh script exists in your shop folder, ShopVault will run it, capture its output, compress the SQL dump, and clean up the uncompressed file. This keeps your database backups lean and organized.

Logging
Every action â€” whether itâ€™s a successful backup or a missing file â€” is logged in backup.log. This ensures you can always audit your backup process and check what happened, without reading cryptic error messages.

Configurable Paths
By default, ShopVault operates in ~/Downloads/shop. You can easily change the files_location variable to point to any other directory where your shop data lives.

Compression Ninja
ShopVault uses bzip2 compression for maximum storage efficiency, ensuring your backups are compact but fully retrievable.

Safe and Silent
Missing folders or files wonâ€™t break the script. ShopVault handles everything gracefully, logging issues instead of failing loudly.

How to Use

Place the script in your shop folder, e.g., ~/Downloads/shop/backup.sh.

Make it executable:

chmod +x backup.sh

./backup.sh

Watch as ShopVault generates:

customer_YYYY_MM_DD.tar.bz2

inventory_YYYY_MM_DD.tar.bz2

backup_YYYY_MM_DD.sql.bz2

All files are neatly compressed and timestamped for easy identification.

~/Downloads/shop/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ backup_db.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ customers_data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customer1.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ customer2.txt
â””â”€â”€ inventory_data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ inventory1.csv
    â””â”€â”€ inventory2.txt


All messages are appended to backup.log, including:

Files successfully backed up

Missing folders or files

Database backup completion
